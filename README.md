# College-Bus-Management-System
This is a college bus management system created using Microsoft SQL server. This system is intended to be used by a transport administrator of a college to perform simple operations such as monitoring the fees paid by students or assigning Drivers to Buses 
or Buses to a certain Route.
The advantage of this system is flexibility, for exmample we have a list of Bus Stops that the college is willing to pick up students 
from based on the response from the students the college will design the route such that it can pick up most of the students from that
area. The Route or the bus that travels from that Route does not stay the same but the relations within the system still stay the same
regardless.
